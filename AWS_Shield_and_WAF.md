### **Overview**
AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.

### **Key Features**
- **Web ACLs (Access Control Lists)**: Create rules to allow, block, or count web requests based on conditions like IP addresses, HTTP headers, HTTP body, or URI strings.
- **Managed Rule Groups**: Use pre-configured rules from AWS or AWS Marketplace sellers to protect against common threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and more.
- **Rate-Based Rules**: Automatically block IP addresses that exceed a specified request rate.
- **Integration with AWS Services**: AWS WAF can be deployed on Amazon CloudFront, Application Load Balancer (ALB), and AWS API Gateway.
- **Real-Time Metrics and Logging**: Monitor and log web requests in real-time using Amazon CloudWatch and AWS WAF logs.

### **Use Cases**
- **Protecting Against OWASP Top 10 Threats**: AWS WAF can be configured to protect against common web vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP Top 10.
- **Bot Control**: Use AWS WAF to block or allow traffic from bots.
- **Geo-Blocking**: Restrict access to your application based on geographic locations.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect your application from brute force attacks by limiting the number of requests from a single IP address.

## **3. Structure and Flow**

### **How AWS Shield and AWS WAF Work Together**
1. **Traffic Flow**:
   - Incoming traffic first passes through AWS Shield, which detects and mitigates DDoS attacks.
   - Traffic then passes through AWS WAF, which inspects and filters HTTP/HTTPS requests based on predefined rules.
   - Clean traffic is forwarded to your application hosted on AWS services like EC2, ALB, or CloudFront.

2. **Integration**:
   - AWS Shield Advanced integrates with AWS WAF to provide enhanced DDoS protection and granular traffic control.
   - AWS WAF rules can be customized to work in conjunction with Shield Advanced’s DDoS mitigation techniques.

### **Flow Diagram**
